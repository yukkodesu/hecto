# Hecto

[Hecto](https://www.flenker.blog/hecto/), a basic text editor, Rust Practice Project by PhilippFlenker

Hecto is a re-implementation of [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) in Rust.

# About

Hecto itself is implemented using [termion](https://crates.io/crates/termion) crate which doesn't support some terminal environment (windows console host)

This version is using [crossterm](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm). It should be working crossplatform.
